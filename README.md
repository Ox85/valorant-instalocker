# Valorant Instalocker

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/omHJyxg.png">

This tool is a Java-based Valorant agent instalocker that automatically selects your preferred agent during character selection. It interfaces directly with Valorant's API using your local lockfile credentials.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Reads Valorant's lockfile to obtain authentication tokens
- Interfaces with Riot's API to:
  - Verify your agent ownership
  - Get current game state
  - Lock your selected agent
- Features a sleek dark-mode GUI with agent icons
- Organizes agents by their roles (Duelist, Controller, Initiator, Sentinel)
- Only shows agents you own (with Jett, Phoenix, Brimstone, Sova, and Sage enabled by default)

## üìÅ Setup

### 1. Requirements

- Java 16 or higher
- Valorant must be running (for lockfile access)
